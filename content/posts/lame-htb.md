## Room Information

- Room name: Lame

## Tools Used

- Nmap
- Searchsploit
- Metasploit

## Code Review & Exploitation

Upon running Nmap, I discovered three interesting open ports: SSH, FTP, and Samba.

The FTP service is vsftpd 2.3.4, and my initial attempt was to connect anonymously. I managed to gain access, but it seemed limited. However, exploring through FTP did not yield much information.

In Searchsploit, I found a potential exploit for vsftpd 2.3.4.

Unfortunately, this exploit did not work effectively, so I decided to focus on the Samba service.

I attempted the "username map script" exploit ([CVE-2007â€“2447](http://cvedetails.com/cve/cve-2007-2447)), which appeared to be the most promising way to authenticate.

Finally, we gained access.

## Lessons Learned

- What did you learn from the room?
    
    I learned how to exploit Samba and gained a basic understanding of machine attack methodology.
    
- Were there any new tools or techniques used?
    
    No new tools were used, but I improved upon my previous knowledge.
    
- What would you do differently next time?
    
    Next time, I would aim to capture better screenshots of my progress. ðŸ˜…
