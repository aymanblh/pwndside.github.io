## Room Information

- Room name: Bashed
- Difficulty level: Easy
- Room link: https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Bashed

![Untitled](/HTB/bashed-icon.png)

## Tools Used

- Nmap

## Port Scanning

![Untitled](/HTB/bashed-1.png)

In the port scan we can see that the only service running is a web server.

## Enumeration

![Untitled](/HTB/bashed-4.png)

![/Untitled](/HTB/bashed-5.png)

If we visit the website there are only one article with a web reverse shell information called phpbash, and a url to the github project.

In the url we can find some useful information like how works, this shell removes the necessity of do a traditional reverse shell.

Letâ€™s try this but first some fuzzing

![Untitled](/HTB/bashed-6.png)

We can see that there is a uploads directory maybe we can try to upload a reverse shell.

With nikto, I found that the /dev directory maybe its useful

![Untitled](/HTB/bashed-7.png)

Inside the directory, there are two files, the two of them are the reverse shell which we have seen in the previous github project (seems like a reverse shell to his own machine). If we try to run one we get in.

## **Gaining an Initial Foothold**

![Untitled](/HTB/bashed-8.png)

We are logged like the web service and the user flag is in the arrexel home directory.

Now letâ€™s elevate privilege

If we go to the / directory we can see that inside there is a script folder created by scriptmanager user.

When we try sudo -l we found that the the www-data user has acces to scriptmanager as sudo.

Letâ€™s try `sudo -u scriptmanager -e /bin/bash` 

![Untitled](/HTB/bashed-10.png)

Donâ€™t seem to work, maybe the web server doesnâ€™t allow some commands.

Now letâ€™s try to upload the reverse shell and this time trying to connect it to our machine instead of using the shell on /dev.

One way is to create a http server and curl the file in the victim machine. We need to modify the reverse shell file that I get [here](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell) with our ip and port.

Now letâ€™s open a listening port with netcat and run the shell.

![Untitled](/HTB/bashed-13.png)

![Untitled](/HTB/bashed-14.png)

Before nothing, we are going to pass from a dumb shell to a fully interactive one.

First once we spawn a bash with `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")` then lets keep the nc in background with ctrl^z, once done we use `stty raw -echo` and then `fg` to return to the web shell but fully interactive this time.

![Untitled](/HTB/bashed-14-2.png)

Letâ€™s retry `sudo -u scriptmanager -e /bin/bash`

![/HTB/bashed-15.png](/HTB/bashed-15.png)

We are scriptmanager now, letâ€™s see what we can do in the /scripts folder
